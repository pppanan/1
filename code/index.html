        <h1>Pet-friendly Singapore</h1>

        <p>Nowadays, more and more people are choosing to keep pets, and the concept of <i>pet-friendly cities</i> has become a trending topic of discussion.Bringing pets along for short trips and hangouts has become a growing trend. To further enhance Singapore as a pet-friendly city, we aim to analyze pet-friendly restaurants and park facilities. 
            <br><br> 
            Through this <i>interactive story map</i>, we have sourced data from <i>https://vanillapup.com/</i> and <i>https://www.nparks.gov.sg/visit/parks/pets</i> on the distribution of pet-friendly spots across Singapore. Our analysis focuses on their spatial distribution and walkability, assessing how accessible these locations are for pet owners and their furry companions.
            <br><br>
            In the <i>crowdsourced map</i>, We will collect newly discovered pet-friendly spots from users to refine the map and identify additional high-demand areas.
